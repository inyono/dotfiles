## Installation

### Using GNU Stow

Clone this repository wherever you want (I keep it in `~/.dotfiles` with an additional private repository `~/dotfiles-private`) and

```
git clone https://github.com/inyono/dotfiles.git
```

Use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage the symlinks.
```
cd dotfiles
git stew [subdirectory]
```
